				☛ A crowd barged past dioramas, glass displays, 
                and wide-eyed security guards in the American
                 Museum of Natural History. Screams rang out 
                 as some runners fell and were trampled. 
                 Upon arriving at a lecture hall, 
                 the mob broke down the door.<br><br>
				☛ The date was Jan. 8, 1930, 
                and the New York museum was showing
                 a film about Albert Einstein and
                  his general theory of relativity.<br><br>
				☛ Einstein was not present, 
                but 4,500 mostly ticketless people
                 still showed up for the viewing.
                  Museum officials told them “no ticket, 
                  no show,” setting the stage for, 
                  in the words of the Chicago Tribune,
                   “the first science riot in history.”<br><br>
				☛ Such was Einstein’s popularity. 
                As a publicist might say, he was
                 the whole package: distinctive look
                  (untamed hair, rumpled sweater), witty
                   personality (his quips, such as God not playing dice, would live on) 
                   and major scientific cred (his papers upended physics).<br><br> 
                ☛ Time magazine named him Person of the Century.
                 His prowess in physics made him one of the greatest scientists of all time.
                  <strong>“Mark Marturello”</strong>
				<br><br> ☛ In 1933, Einstein accepted a professorship 
                at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.,
                 where for years he tried (unsuccessfully) to unify the
                  laws of physics. He became a U.S. citizen in 1940, 
                  and his fame grew as a public intellectual, civil
                   rights supporter and pacifist.
